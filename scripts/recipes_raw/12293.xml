Here is a recipe which is well worth trying. The banana flavour is strongest when you use overripe bananas.

<ingredients>
2 cups self-raising four
1/2 cup castor sugar
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1/2 tsp salt
100g butter
1 cup milk
1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup (2-3) mashed bananas
</ingredients>

<steps>
Heat oven to 220°C (210°C fanbake), with the rack just below the middle.
With a fork, stir the flour, castor sugar, chocolate chips and salt together in a large bowl.
Melt the butter in another large bowl, remove from the heat, then add the milk, egg and vanilla and beat well.
Mash and measure the bananas, then stir them into the liquid.
Tip all the flour mixture into the bowl with the liquid mixture.
Fold everything together carefully until all the flour is dampened, stopping before the mixture is smooth (see page 90).
Spray 12 regular muffin pans with nonstick spray. Put about 1/4 cup of mixture into each cup.
Bake for 12â€”15 minutes, until muffins spring back when pressed in the centre.
