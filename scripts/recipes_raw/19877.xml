This stuffing makes enough to fill the
cavity of a size 9 bird.

<ingredients>
30 g butter
1/2 onion, finely chopped
2 cups fresh bread crumbs
1 diced apple, peeled
2 rashers bacon (optional)
~ 1/2 cup chopped fresh herbs (parsley, sage, thyme, dill, rosemary, chives, oregano)*
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup sultanas or other dried fruits like chopped apricots or chopped prunes
</ingredients>

<steps>
Place the chopped onion in a bowl with the butter
and microwave on high for 3-4 minutes. Add the
rest of the ingredients and mix well. If you like. add
bacon t0 the stuffing — cook first and add.

Remember with poultry — it is important to
always have the stuffing and the bird at the same
temperature. Placing a hot stuffing in a very cold
bird is not advised. Let the stuffing cool slightly
before placing inside the bird.

Note: This may seem like a heavy measure of fresh
herbs and you can certainly reduCe the quantity if
you prefer, but my pleasure in visiting the vegetable
garden to cut fresh herbs for the stuffing is a
highlight in the preparation, and our family just
loves the intensity of mixed herb flavour you get
with this recipe.

Wrap your stuffed Chicken with bacon and bake as
you would normally ~ allowing extra time for a
stuffed chicken.
