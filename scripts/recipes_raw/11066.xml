<ingredients>
8 cups of apples, peeled and seeded
1 cup of fresh cider
1/3 cup brown sugar

</ingredients>

<steps>
Cook the apples in cider over medium heat until soft. Process to sauce-- texture in food processor
Place the raw sauce in a large dutch oven or casserole.
Add sugar and a spice bag of made cheesecloth containing 3 whole cinnamon sticks, 3 cloves and 1 allspice.
Bake at 300 degrees for one hour. Check for flavor and texture. The sauce should be thick and rich.
Drop a spoonful onto a dish; if a puddle of juice forms around it in the next few seconds the sauce is not done yet.
Place in sterile jars and process 10 minutes in boiling water bath.
Serving Suggestions and Notes: You can use ground spices instead of the whole spices, but the flavour will not be as obvious.
Caution: If the sauce is cooked too long it grows runny again and over spicy.
