<ingredients>
4 c uncooked risoni  - cook according to instruction on pack (don’t overcook it goes goey)
Garlic – to taste or not at all
Bacon – 8 rashers, chop and pan fry until tasty
Chicken about 4 breasts or boneless thighs whatever is cheapest – chop and pan fry
Mushrooms 12 – add to chicken halfway through frying
Spinach 1-2 packs of baby spinach – lots and lots, this shrinks massively when wilted.
Feta – 1 block chopped into cm cubes

Dressing
1/3 cup Italian wine vinegar – or lemon juice would work
1/3 cup olive oil
Mustard – wholegrain (but could leave this out if saving pennies)
Pesto
Sweet chilli sauce  -  splodge it in, probably 1/3 cup maybe more
Cracked pepper and salt
</ingredients>

<steps>
Prep everything in advance, and make the dressing, it all cooks and comes together in 30 minutes
Boil the risoni, and drain in a sieve.  Run a splash of cold over it to reduce bulk of the heat so it doesn’t keep cooking away
Pan fry bacon, remove
Pan fry chicken, add mushrooms, add spinach on top at last minute and watch (this will wilt quite quickly
In a massive bowl or pot toss everything except the feta, add the dressing (don’t be alarmed if the risoni is stuck in a blob, the dressing will fix this)
Add the feta last
