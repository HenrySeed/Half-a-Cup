<ingredients>
125g butter
3/4 C sugar
2 Tbsp golden syrup
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla essence
2 cups flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup milk
2 Tbsp cocoa
1 Tbsp milk
</ingredients>

<steps>
In a medium-sized pot melt the butter.
Add the sugar and golden syrup and stand over a very low heat until golden syrup has mixed with sugar and butter.
Stir but do not boil. Cool pot in cold water and add the eggs and vanilla.
Beat with a fork to mix. Sift the flour, baking soda and baking powder into mixture in pot.
Pour in the milk, then mix thoroughly with a fork to blend the flour and milk with the rest.
The batter should be thinner than a normal butter cake mixture, just thin enough to pour.
Pour half the mixture into a square 20 cm or round 23 cm tin with the bottom lined with baking paper, and the sides lightly buttered or sprayed.
To the remaining mixture add the cocoa and Second measure of milk, and stir to mix.
Pour this layer carefully and evenly over the caramel one.
Bake at 180Â°C for 45 minutes until a skewer poked in the middle comes out clean.
When cold, ice with Chocolate Icing.
