<steps>
To prepare crust, combine the 3/4 cup flour, the 3 tablespoons flour, the 3 tablespoons sugar, and the 1/2 teaspoon of the lemon peel.
Cut in butter till crumbly. Stir in 1 slightly beaten egg yolk and 1/4 teaspoon of the vanilla. Pat 1/3 of the dough onto the bottom of an 8 or 9 inch spring- form pan (with sides removed).
Bake in a 400F oven for 7 minutes or till golden. Cool.
Butter the sides of pan; attach to bottom. Pat remaining dough onto sides of pan to a height of 1 3/4 inches; set aside.
For the filling, in a large mixer bowl beat together the softened cream cheese, remining lemon peel, and remaining vanilla till fluffy.
Stir together the 1 cup sugar, the 2 tablespoons flour, and the salt; gradually stir into cream cheese mixture. Add the 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk all at once, beating at low speed just till combined. Stir in milk.
Turn into crust-lined pan. Bake in a 450F oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 300F; bake 50 to 55 minutes more or till center appears set and a knife comes out clean.
Cool 15 minutes. Loosen sides of cheesecake from pan with a spatula. Cool 30 minutes; remove sides of pan. Cool about 2 hours longer. Chill thoroughly. Top with Cherry Sauce.
Cherry Sauce: In a saucepan combine 3/4 cups sugar, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, and dash salt. Stir in 1/3 cup water. Stir in 4 cups fresh or frozen unsweetened pitted tart red cherries, thawed. Cook and stir till thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes more. Cover. Chill without stirring. (Or, use one 21 ounce can cherry pie filling instead of sauce.)
