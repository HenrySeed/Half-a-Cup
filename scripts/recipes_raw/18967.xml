<ingredients>
5 g (1 tsp) active yeast
approximately 180 ml lukewarm water
300 g (2 C) strong flour
1 1/2 tbsp milk powder
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
15 g butter, cold but pliable
egg wash, see page 64
sesame seeds or poppy seeds for coating
</ingredients>

<steps>
Mix the yeast with some of the warm water and set aside.
Sieve dry ingredients together.
Mix in the yeast and enough warm water to form a dough.
Knead well.
Mix in the butter and continue kneading until smooth and elastic.
Place in an oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap.
Place in a warm place to prove until double in size.
When half risen, knock back, then continue proving.
When dough has doubled in size, shape the dough as required.
If not baking in a tin, place the shaped dough on a lightly greased
tray or baking paper.
Egg wash and top with sesame or poppy seeds if required.
Prove in a warm place until correctly risen.
Heat the oven to 230 °C. Either spray cold water into the oven or
place a container of ice cubes into the base of the oven.
Bake the bread for 15—20 minutes.
