<ingredients>
1 packet cannelloni tubes (about 16)
----Sauce----
2 medium-Sized onions
4 cloves garlic
2 Tbsp oil
1 small green pepper
1 tsp basil
1/2 tsp thyme
1/2 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 (300 g) can tomato puree
1 Tbsp wine vinegar
1/4 cup water
----Filling----
about 1 kg of fresh spinach (2 cups when lightly cooked)
1 cup cottage cheese
1 tsp dried oreganum
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp grated nutmeg
black pepper to taste
----Topping----
I cup cream cheese
1 cup grated cheese
</ingredients>

<steps>
Chop the onions finely and peel and chop the garlic.
Sauté in the oil, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the chopped green pepper and continue to cook until everything has softened and the onion turns clear.
Add the seasonings, then the can of tomato purée, vinegar and water.
Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and leave to simmer while you prepare the filling.
Bring a large pot of water to the boil, then add the fresh spinach.
Cook for a minute or two, just until the spinach has softened and wilted, then remove from the heat and drain well.
Coarsely chop the spinach, then return to the pot or a medium-sized bowl.
Add the cottage cheese and remaining filling ingredients to the spinach, and mix everything together.
Select a shallow casserole dish that will hold all the cannelloni tubes comfortably, then butter it lightly.
Fill each cannelloni tube, then place in the casserole dish.
(There is no neat and tidy way to do this — just use your hands.
Don’t stuff the tubes too full or they may break, or you might run out of filling.
Look for ‘instant’ cannelloni tubes when shopping —— these make life much easier as you don’t have to cook them first.)
